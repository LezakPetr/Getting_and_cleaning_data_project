The script run_analysis.R reads files "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt" and "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt" to obtain raw features, files "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt" and "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt" to obtain activities corresponding to the features and files "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt" and "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt" to obtain subject IDs. Train and test sets are merged together.
Tidy dataset contains means of original mean and standard deviation columns calculated per subject and activity. Each row contains the mean for the single combination of activity and subject in original units together with columns activity (textual representation of the activity) and subject (numeric ID).
