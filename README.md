The script run_analysis.R should be run by R interpretter. It reads data from subdirectory UCI HAR Dataset which can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . The script produces file tidy_data.txt and (as intermediate result) data.csv .
